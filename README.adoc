= Raspberry Pi Cluster Project

== General Information

My family has taken on to start and work on a tech side project during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020.

My wife, Sheryl, and I being technology engineers by trade thought it would be great to enlist the help of our kids,
Liam (9) and Lana (6), to work on something on the side after work and remote schooling, and/or on weekends while we're
stuck at during this pandemic. Building and working a Raspberry Pi cluster would really be awesome, hence, this project
was born.
